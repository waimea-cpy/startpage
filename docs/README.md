# ü™¥ Overview

A minimalistic and customisable startpage featuring the [**Catppuccin palettes**](https://catppuccin.com/palette). Designed for both aesthetics and functionality, with seamless hosting on GitHub Pages. This startpage is based on [`dawn`](https://github.com/b-coimbra/dawn), which offers additional functionality. I have refined the page to match my [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/pivoshenko/dotfiles); feel free to explore them as well.

## üß† Main Principles

- Minimalism in all aspects
- Consistency throughout the user interface and codebase
- Simplicity in design and configuration
- Unified style and reduced visual noise

## üé® Supported Palettes

- Latte
- Frapp√©
- Macchiato
- Mocha

## ‚≠ê Features

- Automatic theme switching based on system settings (light/dark mode)
- Customisable startpage / bookmarks manager
- Search bar with multiple engines
- Weather widget
- Clock widget with 12/24-hour format and multiple time zones support

# ü™µ Usage

1. Fork this repository and clone it
2. Optionally remove the `.github` directory, as it contains only PR templates, issue labels, etc., that are linked to this repository
3. Create [`userconfig.js`](userconfig.example.js) based on the example file:
   - Set the desired palette: `latte`, `frappe`, `macchiato`, or `mocha`
   - Set your location for the weather widget
   - Update the number of tabs and their banners
   - Update bookmarks and quick links for those you use most

> [!TIP]
> You can find icons for your bookmarks using [`tabler-icons`](https://tabler.io/icons).
>
> To reduce icon loading times, you may install the icon [font](src/fonts) locally and activate the option `"localIcons": true` in the configuration to disable remote styles.
>
> To improve privacy and loading performance, you can now use local fonts instead of Google Fonts CDN by setting `"localFonts": true` in your configuration. This feature stores all required fonts (Roboto, Nunito, Raleway, and Material Icons) locally in the repository, eliminating external requests to Google's servers.

### üîé Search

<p align="center">

</p>

The search dialogue allows you to display a search bar with various search engines defined in the configuration. To open the search dialogue, simply press `s` and type your query or URL to jump to it seamlessly.

To select search engine, simply prefix the query with the corresponding `!<id>`. By default, the defined search engines are:

- `!p`: PerplexityAI
- `!g`: Google
- `!d`: DuckDuckGo

The default search engine can be set in the `userconfig.js` file (use the engine ID without the `!` prefix):

```javascript
search: {
  default: "d"
}
```

### ‚è∞ Clock

The startpage now features an enhanced clock component with:

- Support for 12-hour and 24-hour time formats
- Multiple clocks for different time zones
- Customisable formatting options
- Locale support for regional time display

You can configure the clock format and add additional time zones in your `userconfig.js`:

```javascript
clock: {
  format: "k:i p", // 12-hour format with AM/PM (09:30 PM)
  icon_color: palette.maroon,
},
// Optional: Add multiple clocks for different time zones
additionalClocks: [
  {
    label: "NYC", // Label for the clock
    timezone: "America/New_York", // IANA timezone name (handles DST automatically)
    format: "h:i", // 24-hour format (21:30)
    locale: "en-US", // Locale for date/time formatting
    icon_color: palette.blue // Optional different icon color
  }
],
```

For full documentation of clock format options, [see](docs/CLOCK.md).
